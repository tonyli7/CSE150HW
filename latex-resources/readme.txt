Dear class,I'd like to compile a small help guide for how to get started with latex on different platforms.My favorite latex editor for Windows is WinEdt.  My favorite latex editor for the Macintosh is TexShop. For the Macintosh, you can download the entire latex package as part of mactex (http://tug.org/mactex/). I don't yet have a favorite latex editor for Linux, although texworks is pretty good. I often just use the standard editor which already understands the latex syntax.I would appreciate students in the class providing advice to me and to other students so that I can update this document.In terms of drawing programs, xfig is very powerful. I don't like the user interface, because there are too many mouse clicks, but otherwise it's a great program. Inkscape is also supposed to be great. For Macintosh, I like OmniGraffle. Sometimes it's easier just to make simple figures in PowerPoint and saving to Encapsulated PostScript or even to scan or photograph or drawing.I'm very interested in feedback from the class about what things worked and didn't work.Cheers,M
